# TutorialWeatherApp
This repository is made public for me to let you know my advance with Kotlin, so here is a tutorial I followed.

The goal of this project is to create a Kotlin Android App with [Clean Code Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).

I struggled quite a bit in the beginning to understand a new structure. I still managed to follow the tutorial so I'm happy with the fact that I learned something new.
